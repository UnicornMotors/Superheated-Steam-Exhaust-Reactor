# Superheated-Steam-Exhaust-Reactor
A technology that uses Superheated Steam & air (oxygen) injection to give reaction energy to Oxidize or Thermolysis of pollutants or Fuel!

# Application:
## SynGas & Wood Gas Generation
Using the energy from Steam to break down feedstock, like Wood & Tires!

## Diesel Particulate matter & Filter
This would be a far superior process to today's Diesel Particulate Filter "Regeneration" cycle!
